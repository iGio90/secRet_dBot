## Rules

There is no restriction on conding stuffs inside. One day the bot will auto-update itself from github (at the moment, pull requests are manually reviewed) through pull-requests and community vote.
You can add as many features as you want to see in a bot, even malicious or personal things. Keep in mind, that other people can add and remove your code as well and one day the bot will learn some conditions to kick out bad people from the community.
The bot has been coded very abstract so there is no need to understand how it fully works.
You can read the documentation for learn how to add your features in 5 minutes.
